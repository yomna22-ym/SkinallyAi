While stress has historically been considered merely a psychological phenomenon, researchers now understand that stress has physical repercussions as well. The most notable manifestations of stress typically occur on the skin. Of course, stress affects everyoneâs skin somewhat differently, but the more stressed you are, the more likely you are to experience skin problems."
      },
      {
        "heading": "How Stress Harms Your Skin",
        "body": "STRESS CAN LEAD TO BREAKOUTS\n\n\nThose with acne can probably tell you that stress seems to contribute to further breakouts, but they might not know why. The real culprit here is cortisol, a hormone that is produced when the body is under significant stress, and which signals the skin to produce more oil. This increase in oil can clog pores and cause breakouts. Acne isn’t the only type of breakout triggered by stress. Stress related hives and rashes can also occur due to changes in hormonal levels. These changes can expand blood vessels, leading to red, swollen areas of skin.\n\n\nSTRESS CAN AGGRAVATE EXISTING SKIN CONDITIONS\n\n\nStress doesn’t just cause skin problems - it can also worsen one’s existing skin problems. Inflammatory conditions such as eczema and those related to immune system issues like psoriasis are two prime examples of this phenomenon. There are multiple theories as to why stress aggravates these conditions. For one thing, the chemicals produced during a stress response can exacerbate inflammation. Stress also seems to interfere with the healing process that would normally reduce symptoms related to psoriasis and eczema - stress can lead one to touch one’s skin more frequently, scratching itches, peeling scabs, etc., which leads to further inflammation and slower healing.\n\n\nSTRESS CAN LEAD TO HAIR LOSS\n\n\nNot only is it stressful to lose one’s hair - stress can actually contribute to such hair loss in the first place, creating an unfortunate follicular feedback loop. There are several ways in which stress can induce hair loss. Alopecia areata refers to a type of hair loss specifically triggered by stress. When the body undergoes severe stress, it can prompt the immune system to attack otherwise healthy parts of the body, such as hair follicles. This auto-immune response describes alopecia areata. Telogen effluvium is another stress-related form of hair loss, where hair follicles go into a resting phase due to stress and eventually fall out\n\n\nDE-STRESSING FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR SKIN\n\n\nBy now, it should be clear that the relationship between stress and your skin is a close one. If you want to take good care of your skin, you must also take steps to reduce stress in your life. Here are some ways to de-stress for the sake of your skin and overall health:\n\n\n- Exercise regularly\n- Practice meditation, yoga, breathing exercises, etc.\n- Get the right amount of sleep each night (7-9 hours)\n- Develop a regular, relaxing, refreshing skin care routine\n- Invest in personal time for hobbies, self-reflection, etc.\n- Seek emotional support from those close to you and/or professionals"

This is because the minerals, fiber, vitamins, and nutrients that a balanced, plant-based diet provides help keep your gut microbiome healthy, while avoiding the allergens and irritants that can accompany animal proteins.\n\n\nAn anti-aging diet can help you look younger by packing your daily intake of food with powerful antioxidants like Vitamins C and E. It also helps prevent glycation, which is when sugars get into the skin and cause cross-linking among collagen molecules, which damages and destroys them. Anti-inflammatory elements of an anti-aging diet include spices such as turmeric, cloves, ginger, and garlic, as well as green and black tea, and a healthy amount of fiber."

That’s right – excess sugar consumption can have noticeable, physical effects on your skin’s appearance.\n\n\nKeep reading to learn more about what sugar does to your skin and what you can do to prevent permanent damage."

Eating too much sugar from simple carbohydrates causes your blood sugar levels to rise, which in turn increases inflammation inside the body. If you have an inflammatory skin condition like psoriasis, rosacea, or eczema, a spike in inflammation can trigger or exacerbate your symptoms.\n\n\n2. Premature aging. One of sugar’s most damaging effects is that it makes your skin look prematurely aged. Sugar breaks down collagen and elastin – the proteins that give your skin shape, structure, and firmness. When this occurs, your skin may start to look wrinkled, saggy, dry, and dull.\n\n\n3. Acne breakouts. Excess sugar consumption can increase the risk of acne breakouts. As previously stated, blood sugar spikes trigger inflammation in the body, and increased inflammation can lead to pimples, zits, blackheads, and whiteheads. Additionally, high blood sugar levels cause your body to create more sebum (oil), another factor that contributes to acne breakouts."

Luckily, there are several things you can do to improve your skin’s health.\n\n\nImproving your skin’s health starts by reducing sugar in your diet.\n\n\n- Recognize “hidden sugars.” Sugar is sneaky and goes by multiple names on ingredient lists. High fructose corn syrup, barley malt, maltodextrin….these are just a few other names that sugar hides behind. The first step toward reducing your sugar intake is becoming an expert label reader to uncover and avoid foods with hidden sugars.\n\n\n- Replace processed foods with natural foods. Processed snack foods like cakes, cookies, and candies are packed full of sugar. When a sweet tooth craving hits, try replacing your junk food with natural sugars from berries, fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, and other whole foods. Plain Greek yogurt topped with fruit and nuts is an excellent replacement snack for high sugar processed foods. If you’re in desperate need of a sweeter treat, swap milk chocolate for dark chocolate. Dark chocolate usually has less sugar and additional health benefits (like antioxidants).\n\n\n- Cut down on sugary drinks. Simply eliminating sugar-laden drinks from your diet will make a huge impact. Fruit juices, sodas, wine, cocktails, beer, energy drinks, Gatorade, and fancy coffees from Starbucks are filled to the brim with skin-damaging sugar. Instead, stick to water, coffee, and tea to quench your thirst.\n\n\nOutside of diet changes, there are other things you can do to improve your skin’s health.\n\n\n- Drink plenty of water\n- Get enough sleep\n- Exercise regularly\n- Maintain a good skin care regimen\n- Reduce your stress levels"

        "heading": "1. Sun avoidance practices",
        "body": "\nThere’s no question that the number one way to reduce your risk of skin cancer is to avoid sun exposure. The American Academy of Dermatology confirms that sun exposure is the most preventable risk factor for all skin cancers, including melanoma, and is primarily responsible for premature aging.\n\n\nIn order to reduce your risk of skin cancer, sun avoidance is crucial. But this doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy the outdoors! During outdoor activities, seek the shade whenever possible. It is especially important to seek the shade between the hours of 10AM and 4PM, when the UV rays are the strongest. If the sun is not avoidable, you can protect exposed skin by wearing a wide-brimmed hat, UV-blocking sunglasses, and sun protective clothing.\n\n\nSun protective clothing uses certain fabrics and weave structures to provide sun protection by blocking ultraviolet (UV) radiation. In fact, the clothing is rated based on an Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), which is similar to the Sun Protection Factor (SPF) for sunscreen. The UPF rating system measures the UV protection provided by fabric, representing the ratio of sunburn-causing UV without and with the protection of the fabric. A UPF factor of 50+ is able to block up to 98% of the sun’s rays. It’s important to keep in mind, though, that sun protective clothing should be worn as a second layer of protection and does not replace the need for sunscreen application."

        "heading": "2. Proper sunscreen application",
        "body": "\nProper sunscreen application is one of the most important parts of a complete sun protection regimen, and can help to reduce your risk of skin cancer. While the majority of people understand the importance of sunscreen, not everyone knows which types of sunscreen offer the best protection and how often they should be applying their sunscreen.\n\n\nThere are two main classifications of sunscreens: physical and chemical. Physical sunscreens, which include zinc oxide and titanium oxide, protect your skin by using physical UV filters to block or deflect UV light. Physical sunscreens tend to be better tolerated by most skin types because they are not absorbed into the skin, making them especially useful for those with heat sensitive skin (i.e. rosacea patients). However, physical sunscreens are thicker than chemical sunscreens and can often leave a white cast after application.\n\n\nOn the other hand, chemical sunscreens, such as avobenzone and oxybenzone, protect the skin by first absorbing UV light, then transforming that light energy into some other form of energy, such as heat. A benefit of chemical sunscreens is their ability to defend the deeper layers of skin, including collagen fibers and other tissue, against the aging effects of UVA rays, as well as preventing penetration by the UVB rays responsible for tanning and sunburn.\n\n\nAs both physical and chemical sunscreens have their pros and cons, many of today’s sunscreens contain both physical and chemical UV filters.\n\n\nWhether you choose a physical or a chemical sunscreen, it’s important that it is a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen. Broad spectrum refers to the two types of UV light that can harm your skin: UVA and UVB. UVA rays can prematurely age your skin, whereas UVB rays can burn your skin. Both types of rays can cause skin cancer. A broad-spectrum, or full-spectrum, sunscreen protects you from both. Most dermatologists agree that choosing sunscreen with SPF 30 is the safest way to go. Anything above SPF 30 is not usually necessary as it has little incremental benefit and below 30 does not offer enough protection.\n\n\nThe Skin Cancer Foundation recommends applying 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of sunscreen to your entire body 30 minutes before going outside. Reapply every two hours or immediately after swimming or excessive sweating."

The first time you examine your skin, spend time carefully going over the entire surface. Learn the pattern of moles, blemishes, freckles, and other marks on your skin so that you’ll notice any changes next time.\n\n\nAccording to The Skin Cancer Foundation, a study in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute demonstrated that skin self-exams could reduce the risk of advanced disease among melanoma patients and potentially decrease melanoma mortality by up to 63 percent. When performing a self-exam for irregular moles that may be an indication of melanoma, look for the “ABCDEs”:\n\n\n- Asymmetry\n- Borders that are irregular\n- Color that is varied\n- Diameter – melanomas are typically larger than the size of a pencil eraser\n- Evolution, or change, in any of these characteristics over time\n"

Too much UV exposure can increase free radical production, and at these high concentrations they can be hazardous to the body and damage all major cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and cell membranes. According to the National Cancer Institute, the damage to cells caused by free radicals, especially the damage to DNA, may play a role in the development of cancer and other health conditions."

        "body": "\nCoffee is a must-have for some people who rely on it to feel awake and alert in the morning and throughout the day. But there are characteristics to the beverage that might not be best for your skin.\n\n\nCoffee is Dehydrating\n\n\nCoffee is a diuretic which means it pulls water from the body, including the skin. When skin is dehydrated it’s more likely to look dull and less plump. Fine lines, wrinkles and under eye bags are more apparent when skin isn’t getting enough moisture.\n\n\nCaffeine Triggers a Stress Response\n\n\nCaffeine will make you feel alert, but does so by triggering a stress response, which leads to the release of a hormone called cortisol. When cortisol is high, the skin produces more oil (sebum) which can make you vulnerable to acne breakouts. Long term cortisol exposure also speeds the aging process.\n\n\nCaffeine May Cause Sleep Loss\n\n\nIf you’re drinking several cups of coffee per day or indulging in the afternoon or evening, you may experience sleep loss. Loss of sleep keeps cortisol levels high, but affects skin in other ways too. Skin cell repair and rejuvenation happens during REM sleep. Without a good night’s sleep, skin ages faster.\n\n\nCoffee Constricts Blood Vessels\n\n\nDrinking coffee leads to vasoconstriction, which can prevent blood and oxygen from circulating in the small capillaries that are closest to skin’s surface. This can lead to a dull complexion and crepe-like wrinkles.\n\n\nAdditional Ingredients Can Be Damaging\n\n\nIf you take your coffee with dairy, you could be making your acne worse or increasing your risk of a breakout. Evidence suggests dairy (especially non-organic) makes acne around the mouth and jawline worse. Dairy is also inflammatory for most people, potentially leading to puffiness around the eyes.\n\n\nIf you’re adding sugar to your cup of Joe, you’re potentially increasing free radicals and damaging collagen and elastin. Collagen prevents wrinkles and keeps skin voluminous by giving it structure. Elastin gives skin its stretch, which prevents sagging. Excess sugar can also contribute to acne or rosacea.\n\n\nHow can coffee benefit skin?\n\nThe skin benefits of coffee appear to be better realized when coffee is applied topically. Skin care products with this caffeinated ingredient are increasingly available.\n\n\nCoffee as an Antioxidant\n\n\nWhen you drink it with sugar, coffee increases free radicals through a process called glycation. But when applied topically, coffee’s antioxidant properties can reduce free radicals and benefit skin by keeping it youthful.\n\n\nCoffee as a Vasoconstrictor\n\n\nIngesting too much coffee can constrict blood flow, leaving skin dull. But as a topical, coffee can help reduce redness for those with rosacea. When applied around the eyes, it might also reduce puffiness.\n\n\nCoffee as a Skin Brightener\n\n\nCoffee grounds can act as exfoliants in coffee-based face masks. Caffeine may also brighten skin thanks to the high concentrations of antioxidants and its vasoconstrictive properties.\n"

Going without polish lets your doctor examine your hands and feet.\n- Let your hair down: Skin cancers often develop on the scalp. Wearing a loose hair style makes it easier for your doctor to examine your head.\n- Skip the makeup: Your doctor may use a special instrument called a dermatoscope to look closely at the skin on your face.

        "heading": "Yes, These Are All Signs of Sun Damage!",
        "body": "\n1. Wrinkles: I tell my patients that more than 90 percent of wrinkles associated with aging are actually related to cumulative sun damage. Collagen and elastin are proteins that make your skin firm, supple and resilient, but UV radiation from sun exposure can destroy them. Dermatologists call chronic sun damage through the years “photoaging,” and, of course, it leads to wrinkles. Think about it: We don’t see many wrinkles on unexposed skin, such as the buttocks, breasts or other areas where the sun doesn’t shine. Exposed skin tends to be more wrinkled, and the sun plays a huge role in that.\n\n\n2. Broken blood vessels: Have you noticed some red, spidery veins around your nose and cheeks? Yes, those are caused by exposure to UV light. When people say they have “broken” blood vessels, that’s a misnomer. If the blood vessels were broken, they’d bleed into the skin and cause bruises. In actuality, these vessels are enlarged. They’re “broken” in that they’re not doing what they’re supposed to be doing, which is pumping the blood from one area to the next and staying trim (or tight) and, therefore, invisible.\n\n\nElastin fibers normally hold the blood vessels taut. But when those fibers are broken down by sun exposure, they are unable to support the vessels and hold them tight. The blood vessels thus enlarge (or sag) — and become visible. Many patients present with enlarged vessels on the sides of their nose or cheeks, but it’s also common for large blood vessels to appear on the chest, which often gets a lot of sun exposure.\n\n\n3. Brown Spots: No matter how many times my patients tell me that they’ve had brown spots or freckles all their lives, I gently reply, “No, you haven’t.” It’s just a fact. When a patient tells me, “Well, my mother said I was born with them,” I say, “No, you weren’t. When your mother put you outdoors and exposed your skin to sun for the first time, that’s when you developed freckles.”\n\n\nDermatologists call freckles “ephelides” and larger tan spots “solar lentigos.” Most people often refer to them as age spots, but they’re not related to age; they are related to sun exposure. Sometimes they can coalesce and become big brown spots — which are different from pigmented brown birthmarks or scaly lesions called keratoses. \n\n\n4. Hyperpigmentation: Patients often complain of blotchy or mottled skin, with evidence of dark and light patches. Sometimes there may be evidence of red discoloration as well. This is a common cosmetic concern and does not indicate an underlying medical condition. Inflamed skin can become hyperpigmented, and a frequent cause of such skin inflammation is sun exposure.\n\n\nHyperpigmentation and skin blotchiness drive many people to seek treatment. Most patients are not aware that the dark discoloration is related to chronic sun damage. Many may have used over-the-counter skin lightening products that can often increase skin irritation and inflammation, leading to yet more pigmentation.\n\n\nWith so many people wearing masks during the pandemic, facial skin that often receives incidental sun exposure has been more protected. Regrettably, most people don’t apply enough sunscreen or use it consistently. However, because masks provide a physical block to the sun, they have had an unintentional positive effect: I have noted far less hyperpigmentation on the lower face of my patients over the past two years!\n\n\n5. Melasma: Wearing a protective face mask has also helped with signs of melasma, which appears as dark patches on sun-exposed facial skin, particularly on the cheekbones. While hormones such as estrogen can worsen melasma, its appearance is primarily caused by skin inflammation induced by chronic (or repeated) sun exposure.\n\n\n6. Blackheads: We’re not talking about blackheads associated with acne, but about clusters of blackheads that appear on the temples and cheeks as a consequence of diminished skin elasticity due to chronic sun exposure. The loss of elastin fibers causes skin crevices and pores to enlarge, thus trapping dirt in them that turns black. This condition is called Favre-Racouchot syndrome and is most commonly seen in middle-aged men with a history of excessive sun exposure.\n\n\n7. A red neck: This is different than getting an acute burn after recent sun exposure. A permanently red (and often net-like or spotty discoloration) on the lateral sides of the neck and central chest is a condition called poikiloderma.\n\n\nPeople who spend a lot of time outside, such as gardeners, construction workers, truck drivers and athletes, are particularly prone to this condition because of the extended period of time those areas are exposed to UV light. The exposed neck and chest skin develops enlarged blood vessels, which permanently cause the skin to appear red. It’s interesting that the skin under the chin is often unaffected because of the shadow the chin casts on the front of the neck, thereby shading it from the sun.\n\n"

        "heading": "Reversing Sun Damage",
        "body": "\nConsistent sun protection: I evaluate patients with sun damage all day long. Before I perform any treatment in the office, I encourage my patients to do their homework. The first thing is to prevent future skin damage by applying sunscreen on all exposed skin, but especially the face — every single day, all year long. I also recommend that additional sun-shielding measures be used, such as wearing protective clothing, hats and sunglasses and, whenever possible, seeking shade.\n\n\nBetter skin care: Additional homework involves adhering to a consistent skin care maintenance program. I recommend that my patients follow a good skin-care routine for at least one month prior to in-office treatments. It shows me that they are team members and doing their part to achieve the common goal of radiant, healthy skin! Here is my prescription:\n\n\nIn the morning: Protect. Before you apply your facial sunscreen in the morning, put on a topical antioxidant vitamin C product. It will enhance your sunscreen’s ability to protect your skin from free radicals that can damage it. A vitamin C serum or gel can also help stimulate new collagen production, effectively making skin healthier.\nIn the evening: Repair. To help repair or even reverse sun damage, your best weapon is a vitamin A derivative. What does that mean? Well, if your skin can handle it, you can use Retin-A. Many patients are unable to use Retin-A every night due to irritation (dryness), so I often recommend a retinol-containing cream or moisturizer that helps to stimulate new collagen production, brighten discolored skin and reduce fine lines. If you want to add anything to this simple formula, I suggest an eye cream that contains peptides, to enhance collagen production in the delicate area around the eyes. Eye creams are best used at night (they rejuvenate while you sleep) but can also be used under makeup during the day.\n\n\nIf you consistently stick with this plan to protect in the morning and repair at night for a month, it sets the stage for any procedure that may be performed in the office. if you stick with it, you can make a difference in the sun damage you already have. It’s like going to the gym: You have to make it a habit.\n\n\nOffice procedures: To reduce wrinkles, there are many treatment options. Wrinkles can be filled in (or plumped up) with any of several cosmetic injectables, including Juvederm and Restylane. Most “fillers” are composed of hyaluronic acid, a natural substance that provides cushioning and structure to the skin. Microneedling of wrinkles with a motorized handheld device that inserts fine needles into the skin to improve skin texture is another treatment option. And, of course, there are a variety of lasers that can resurface the skin and literally vaporize wrinkles away and/or induce new collagen formation to reduce their appearance.\n\n\nIf so-called “broken blood vessels” or sun spots require treatment, specialized lasers are recommended to target and remove the unwanted blood vessels or pigment. It is important that patients avoid sun exposure before and after laser treatment to prevent side effects. Similarly, poikiloderma can be treated using lasers and intense pulsed lights (or IPL) that can treat diffuse skin redness and hyperpigmentation.\n\n\nOn the other hand, for hyperpigmentation or melasma, I recommend chemical peels in lieu of laser treatment because the heat produced by lasers in such sensitive skin can cause"

        "body": "\nIn a detailed analysis of the requests sent to the Skinive bot, we noticed that people are very often worried not about the condition of a particular mole (pigmented nevus), but the quantity of the moles on their body.  Moreover, with further analysis of the situation, it becomes obvious that there is a fact of special oncological alertness due to the appearance of more and more nevi. Many people see high oncological risks in this. But Is it really so dangerous? Is there a need to urgently visit a dermatologist or an oncologist?\nIn fact, there are even more options. In certain cases, you can safely stay at home without the risk of missing a serious skin problem. Spoiler alert: all you need to do is download a mobile application and conduct independent monitoring of the skin condition.\n\n\nIt is important to understand: if there are a lot of nevi on the skin, it does not mean that it is time to look for melanoma.  On the other hand, when there are few nevi, this also does not mean that the skin condition can be ignored.\n\n\nIndeed, in those people who have a lot of nevi, the risk of melanoma is slightly higher.  And the problem is not even that a malignant transformation of the nevus can occur.  Most often, the danger lies in the appearance of a new skin formation, rather than in the change of an existing one.\n\n\nBut both in the first and in the second case (with a large and small number of nevi) – the most optimal tracking option is to draw up a map of moles (this includes all other types of skin neoplasms), when each nevus, hemangioma, or any other skin pathology is considered in detail and is archived with reference to precise localization on the human body for the possibility of re-analysis and comparison in the future.\n\n"

        "body": "\nThe key goal of mapping moles is dynamic observation, which allows to timely identify the appearance of new formations on the skin or identify dangerous changes in them.\n\n\nFor people with few moles, mapping helps to notice changes in already existing neoplasms in time. The appearance of new mole in such people, as a rule, is always noticeable without the use of special devices (for example, there was one mole on the forearm, but now there are two: it is easy to notice the difference).  Although there can be problems here, when the nevus appears in a visually inaccessible place (back, buttocks, back of the thighs).\n\n\nAs for people with multiple nevi (usually more than 50), mapping allows solving two main tasks.\n\n\nThe first task helps to keep track of the appearance of new pigmented neoplasms since it is quite problematic to do it on your own (for example, there are 7-8 nevi on the forearm, the appearance of another one may not be noticed).The second task allows recording any visual changes in long-standing nevi.  And since there are many nevi, here one cannot do without the help of photographic fixation and mapping.  Moreover, in people with multiple nevi, as a rule, external changes in these neoplasms occur more often.\n\n"

They may include:\n\n\n- Active beach season (or any other long stay in the sun, especially with skin burns);\n\n\n- Presence of malignant tumors (especially skin, especially melanoma) in the history;\nPregnancy;\n\n\n- Taking hormonal or immune-inhibiting drugs (immunosuppressants);\n\n\nPeople whose skin is in long-term contact with potential carcinogens due to professional activity.\n\n\nAnd in the case when a person himself suspects the presence of possible dangerous changes in the skin.  The frequency and regularity of mapping in such situations is determined individually at an appointment with a dermatologist or oncologist.\n\n\nIf a person is not in any risk group, it is enough to do mapping once a year in the spring season, before summer, so that later there will be something to compare with (if suddenly after summer there will be changes among skin neoplasms).\n\nIn autumn, immediately after the beach season, the mapping may not be informative due to the fact that there may not be any obvious visual changes provoked by the summer sun by this time."

        "body": "\nIn fact, the process of creating a mole map is quite simple.  Under this term lies a banal photographing of individual areas of the skin, which together should make up the entire body as a whole.  After that, each neoplasm is examined separately for the presence or absence of risks, the exact location, changes in comparison with previous images (if there are archived images) are recorded.\n\n\nGiven the uncomplicated technology, this procedure can be carried out at home using improvised means.  Fortunately, modern mobile phones are equipped with quite good (and sometimes very good) cameras.  Well, or you can use a professional technique.  Processing photos on a PC with an indication of the neoplasms localization should also not be difficult.  In principle, this approach can solve some problems, for example, to fix the appearance of a neoplasm where it did not exist before.  Or, note changes in an already existing neoplasm, but these changes should be sufficiently pronounced (which does not always correspond to the timeliness of seeking medical help).\n\n\nIt is also necessary to understand the presence of a number of other important points:\n\n\n- The process of “home” mapping is not automated, everything is done manually, which requires a lot of time and effort;\n\n\n- The obtained images are not standardized: different distances from the camera to the skin, different lighting, there may be different cameras, different image quality during repeated mapping;\n\n\n - The inability to perform a dermatoscopic image (you can only get a macro photo, a photo of a neoplasm under a magnifying glass is not a dermatoscopy);\n\n\n- Lack of medical opinion.\n\n\nTaking all this into account, skin mapping should only be trusted by professionals and professional techniques.\n\n"

        "body": "\nUsually, mapping of skin neoplasms is performed in health care facilities by specially trained doctors using special equipment.  In the office, there is a stand with one or several cameras that take pictures of a person according to a predetermined algorithm.  Such a device is also equipped with an electronic dermatoscope, with the help of which skin neoplasms are examined in detail under high magnification.  There is also artificial intelligence that helps doctors to make the right decision.  All this information is recorded in the patient’s personal account and stored until the next visit.  Today, this technology is considered the benchmark for skin mapping.\n\n\nOf course, the reliability and result of such a procedure should not raise any doubts.  But here comes another problem: accessibility.  The cost of such installations is estimated at tens of thousands of dollars, which not every doctor and not every medical center can afford, where dermatological and oncodermatological patients are consulted.  Accordingly, not even in every large city, you can find such a service.  And everyone needs to watch out for skin neoplasms.\n\n\nAn alternative way to perform skin mapping can be dedicated mobile applications for smartphones, such as AI Dermatologist.\n\n\nThe main advantages of this approach are accessibility and mobility.\n\n\nThe procedure can be carried out in any office (as opposed to stationary installations, which are tied to a specific office), where there is sufficient lighting and the patient feels comfortable.  The mapping process itself is controlled by artificial intelligence: each neoplasm that the neural network was able to identify is saved and linked to a virtual 3D model of a person.  After the end of the skin scan (also carried out according to a special standardized algorithm, which must be familiarized with before starting the scan), all neoplasms that the neural network previously recognized as potentially dangerous are highlighted for the doctor. After that, each such neoplasm undergoes a more detailed check with a neural network, on the basis of which the doctor makes his conclusion.  All results are stored in the patient’s personal account and are available for comparison at the next mapping.\n\n\nIt is difficult to disagree with the fact that this approach to compiling a mole map most fully meets modern requirements:\n\n\n- It is not tied to a specific doctor’s office;\n\n\n- Available to a wide range of doctors and institutions;\n\n\n- The results can always be at hand or, if necessary, available to other doctors (joint consultations, patient transfer, training).\n\n\nMoreover, in order to carry out mapping in this way, special in-depth knowledge in dermatology or dermato-oncology is not always required.  This technique can be considered as a screening test by general practitioners or other non-skin specialists to properly route the patient.\nThus, our health and the health of our skin, in particular, are truly in our hands."
